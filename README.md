## ⌨️ Wi-Key ⌨️ An Engaging and Educational Typing Practice App

### _Problem_
>The need to make typing practice more engaging and accessible

### _Current services and limitations_
>There are many websites to help people improve their typing speed and accuracy. keybr.com is a very popular website that tracks user performance over time. However, it is not engaging as the example text has no context. typelit.io solves this issue by having users type from public-domain classic novels, but with these long-form texts, it can be difficult for users to form a habit of improving their typing.

### _Solution_
>A typing website/app that engages users by using articles from simple.wikipedia.com, a version of Wikipedia that uses simple English. This way, users can be engaged by learning about new concepts with short articles while also practicing typing. The application will store user metrics like pages read, friends, typing performance, and interests.
